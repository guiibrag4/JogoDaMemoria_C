Hello, this project is a memory game in C with applications of parameters in functions and data structures

This game has easy, medium and difficult levels, but for now only the easy level is complete. The objective of the game is to reveal cards and look for matches between them, forming pairs. At the beginning of the game, the cards appear for 10 seconds for the player to memorize them, and then they turn around and are hidden. As the attempts pass, the player receives a bonus, either because they are winning or because they need a little help. Good game!
